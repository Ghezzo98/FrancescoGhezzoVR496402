#### Project: Implementation of the congruence closure algorithm

In this project I implement the congruence closure algorithm with DAG for the satisfiability of a set of equalities and disequalities in the quantifier-free fragment of the theory of equality. 
The algorithm was explained in class and is described in Sect. 9.3 of the Bradley-Manna textbook.

To run the code, it is necessary to open this file colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yJjFYG-MsTZoqfiuolQ_nL5AOlMjPKLZ?usp=sharing.
Here you can find every step you need to run my algorithm.  
I set the "editing setting" (sharing) of colab to True, this means you can modify or add inputs to test or change lines of code.
